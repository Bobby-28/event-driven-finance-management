## 🔄 Kafka Events Example

| Event Producer    | Kafka Topic          | Event Consumer         |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Order Service     | `order_placed`       | Messaging Service      |
| User Service      | `user_registered`    | Messaging Service      |

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven
- Docker & Docker Compose
- MongoDB & PostgreSQL installed (or use Docker)

### Run Kafka with Docker

```bash
docker-compose -f kafka-docker-compose.yml up -d
Run Microservices
Each service is a Spring Boot app. You can run them individually:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd user-service
mvn spring-boot:run
Or run all with Docker Compose (if configured).

🔐 API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/user/signup	Register new user
POST	/api/user/login	Authenticate & get tokens
GET	/api/products	List all products
POST	/api/orders	Place new order
POST	/api/refresh-token	Generate new access token

Full API documentation available soon.

📧 Kafka + Email Flow (Example)
User places an order.

Order-Service sends message to order_placed Kafka topic.

Messaging-Service consumes the message.

Sends email/SMS to user with order details.

📦 Future Enhancements
 AI-driven product recommendation

 Fraud detection using ML

 Admin dashboard

 GraphQL API support

 Payment gateway integration (Stripe, Razorpay, etc.)

## 🧾 Modules & Responsibilities

| Microservice     | Responsibilities                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| User Service     | Register/Login users, send Kafka event           |
| Token Service    | Generate Access/Refresh Tokens, validate JWTs    |
| Transaction MS   | Manage transactions, produce Kafka messages      |
| Budget Service   | Update budget on transaction events              |
| Goal Service     | Monitor savings goals                            |
| Messaging Service| Consume events and send email/SMS notifications  |
| Registry Service | Eureka Service Discovery                         |
| API Gateway      | Route requests securely to correct microservices |

---

## 🔄 Kafka Topics Used

| Topic Name            | Producer              | Consumer               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| `user_registered`     | User Service          | Messaging Service      |
| `transaction_created` | Transaction Service   | Budget Service, Messaging Service |
| `goal_achieved`       | Goal Service          | Messaging Service      |
| `budget_exceeded`     | Budget Service        | Messaging Service      |

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. Client logs in via **User Service**
2. Credentials verified → User Service calls **Token Service** via Feign
3. Token Service returns **JWT + Refresh Token**
4. Access token is added to headers for secure routes
5. If JWT expires → Frontend sends refresh token to API Gateway
6. API Gateway forwards it to Token Service → New token generated

---

## 📬 Kafka Notification Flow (Example)

```text
User signs up  →  User Service sends 'user_registered' event →
Messaging Service consumes event  →  Sends Welcome Email
